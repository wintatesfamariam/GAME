# GAME
Rock, paper, scissors game

1. We started our project with building the landingpage (index.html).
There we added a header which is the title of our game and three images (of hands making out rock, paper, scissors).
Followed with a dropdown form and a submit button where is says "Let's play!".

2. We linked and added our CSS to the HTML to style our content.

3. We linked and added our JAVASCRIPT to the HTML file.

4. We started our Javascript with the starting point of the computer choice that Geisy provided us.

5. Then we proceeded to get the gamer choice from the dropdown input.
This we did through linking the HTML to the javascript by the GetElementById.

6. After access to both choices was provided we went on writing the if else code for the different outcomes and console.logged them.

7. Because the first code we wrote didn't work we asked a friend for help to figure this out and after that we wrote a new code in index2 and javascript2.

8. In index2 we connected our main function "myfunc" to the submit button with an onclick so that it would call the function when the user clicks the button.

9. Then we proceeded as before with the computer choice that Geisy gave us and got the user choice from the dropdown. 

10. After that we proceeded to console.log the results.

11. We added another function to compare the results with an if else code for the different outcomes. 

12. Then we called the compare function.

13. And in the end we added a clear cache for the selectedValue. 

# GITHUB
To arrange and collaborate on Github has taken up 90% of the time we had up to the deadline of this project.
We had problems cloning, pulling and pushing into different branches. Which resulted in only one branch and less time on figuring out and writing our javascript code.
