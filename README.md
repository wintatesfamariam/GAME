# GAME
Rock, paper, scissors game

1. We started our project with building the landingpage (index.html).
There we added a header which is the title of our game and three images (of hands making out rock, paper, scissors).
Followed with a dropdown form and a submit button where is says "Let's play!".

2. We linked and added our CSS to the HTML to style our content.

3. We linked and added our JAVASCRIPT to the HTML file.

4. We started our Javascript with the starting point of the computer choice that Geisy provided us.

5. Then we proceeded to get the gamer choice from the dropdown input.
This we did through linking the HTML to the javascript by the GetElementById.

6. After access to both choices was provided we went on writing the if else code for the different outcomes and console.logged them.
